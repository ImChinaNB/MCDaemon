## MCDaemon Reloaded

[中文说明](./README_zh.md)

The orginal version of [MCDaemon](https://github.com/kafuuchino-desu/MCDaemon) has been not updated for a long time (9 months). And so it's hard to write some plugins for it because of feature missing.

However, the idea of MCDaemon is great. So here is **MCDaemonReloaded**. I **completely rewrite** MCDaemon in Python 3 and brings more callbacks, a good plugin system and more.

Please keep in mind this project is in **early development** and there's currently no English translation for the program. I'll do that after I finish all the useful plugins and make the program more stable.

If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please submit them in the Issues tab.

*To the original creator kafuuchino-desu: I've PM you for permission to make this project, however i didn't get a response in three months. Tell me if you don't agree and I'll delete this respository as soon as I can.*
